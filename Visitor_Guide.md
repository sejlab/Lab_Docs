### Getting around

Edinburgh is a very walkable city, the only transport options are Uber/Taxi and Lothian Buses (excellent service). For the bus, there is a flat fare of £1.70 for all journeys, or £4 for a day ticket. You must have exact change, which you put into the box next to the driver. There is a useful app that you can download to plan journeys and see the bus times.

### Attractions and Things to do

* National Museum of Scotland (Free) This is a must-see in Edinburgh - the most visited attraction outside London. Busy at the weekend but lots to see and perfect for a rainy day.

* Royal Botanic Gardens (Free, Glasshouse Entry £7) - A lovely green space in Edinburgh. The glasshouses are extensive and whilst a little dated, are worth the price.

* Dean Village and the Old Town (Self-guided Tour) - See the route here: https://www.solosophie.com/edinburgh-walking-tour/ This is a great way to see the nicest parts of Edinburgh, with a climb up Arthur's Seat at the end if you fancy it. I think that would take 3 - 5 hours depending on what you stop and see. The 24 bus from the guesthouse stops very near the starting point.

* Arthur's Seat - A steep climb but great views. Or Calton Hill - A slightly smaller hill with an observatory and the National Monument on top.

* Edinburgh Castle (Free, or £17) - If you do the self-guided tour, then you can walk into the castle walls before the ticket office and have a quick look. Otherwise, I would only pay to go if you really love this kind of thing. Contains the war museum and the crown jewels.

* North Berwick - This is a nice seaside town east of Edinburgh that is easily reached by train. Good seafood, cute cafes & shops and a nice beach. There is also a hill (Berwick Law) to climb for views over the estuary. The nearby Bass Rock is the biggest gannet colony in the world, which you can see from the Scottish Seabird Centre (highly recommended).

* Day Tours (~£50): There are many running from Edinburgh to see other parts of Scotland. A highly rated company is https://www.highlandexperience.com/index.asp
