### In terms of trying to find a place to stay:

When renting a house in the UK, most often they are furnished - they will have everything you need in the kitchen (stove, fridge, washing machine) and things like beds, sofas, tables, chairs etc. Be careful to check whether houses are furnished or unfurnished. You will probably have to have your own dishes, cups etc. but it is easy to find them on Facebook Share pages, Gumtree and there is also an IKEA on the edge of town.

### Some good websites are:

When looking for houses, I don't recommend Gumtree because there can be convincing scams. If you see something good there, don't be shy to send it to us and we can give you our opinion/ quickly check it.

### Getting around:

Most people in Edinburgh get around by walking, cycling or by bus, rather than by car, although there is unofficial parking around the University. The municipal buses (Lothian) are very frequent, very clean and one of the cheapest services in the UK. A single ticket anywhere is £1.70, a day pass is £4 and a monthly pass is £55 (can be cheaper if bought annually through the university). Journey planners are here: https://www.lothianbuses.com/

### Potential places to live within Edinburgh:

* Marchmont, Bruntsfield, Newington (£££): The most convenient for university and very popular for students and staff. Lots of coffee shops, pubs, restaurants and close to the Meadows and Holyrood Park, walking distance from the city centre.

* Morningside (££-££££): Nice suburb and walkable to the university. Posh reputation but some affordable places.

* Polwarth, Shandon, Slateford, Dalry, Gorgie, Colinton (££-£££). These are commutable by bike/bus. Slateford, Gorgie and Dalry never used to be desirable places, but because they have small and affordable flats, young professionals are moving there and it is becoming more gentrified.

* Portobello, Liberton, Leith, Abbeyhill, Newhaven, The Shore, Davidsons Mains, Trinity, Bonnington, Barnton, Corstorphine, Comely Bank: (££-£££). These are nice areas but are bit more of a commute – check before looking.

* Stockbridge and the New Town (£££-££££): very desirable areas and are very popular, but a bit of a commute and can be pricey. Lots of coffee shops, restaurants, again walking distance from the city centre.

* Merchiston, Craiglockhart, The Grange (£££-££££): Very nice suburbs, mostly pricey but occasionally some affordable places.


### What you pay

Landlords or letting agents will ask for £XXX deposit and £XXX per month in rent, and that will be the price you pay - there are no hidden fees and as a student you will not have to pay tax (I will check how it works if Kelsey lives with you, unless you know this from Manchester). Tenants’ rights are taken seriously in Scotland. The landlord cannot spend your deposit - it goes to a governmental scheme which protects that money, so when you leave the flat your landlord will have to make an argument if they want to take some of that for repairs. They also cannot make you sign more than a 6-month fixed contract – after that period it automatically rolls on a month by month basis. After which they cannot ask you to leave unless they have a good reason: https://www.mygov.scot/private-tenant-eviction/grounds-for-eviction-assured-and-short-assured-tenancies/ .
